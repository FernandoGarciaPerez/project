    "of computational linguistics and computer science. Basically, NLP is the process by which machines learn to make sense of human language. Therefore, NLP"+
    " results in a model that can successfully process text and remove any vagueness within it, a process is known as word sense disambiguation.</p> <p>For achieving"+
    " the above-mentioned objective, machines need to be trained with textual data. For the purpose of training the machine, first, the textual training data is pre-processed "+
    "in different ways based on the end objective. The rudimentary preprocessing techniques that are often used are tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop word removal. "+
    "These techniques which are considered baseline are used in some basic applications like document similarity and topic modeling among others. There are other techniques such "+
    "as parts-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition that is used in combination with the previously mentioned baseline techniques for more complex applications like document "+
